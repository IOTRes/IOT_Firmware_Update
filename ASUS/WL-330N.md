# Firmware Integrity Verification Vulnerability in Firmware Update Process of Asus WL-330N


## Affected Product
Asus WL-330N (firmware version: 1.0.2.9)

## Overview
There is a firmware integrity verification vulnerability in Asus WL-330N (firmware version 1.0.2.9). Cyclic redundancy check 32 (CRC32) is used in function sub_41328C() of httpd to verify the integrity of new firmware image header during firmware update process. CRC32 verification cannot detect whether the new firmware is a tampered firmware because hackers could craft a tampered firmware with the same CRC32 value as the new firmware to bypass CRC32 verification. Therefore, a crafted firmware could be written into the IOT device through firmware update and could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
