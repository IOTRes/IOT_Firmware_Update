# Firmware Integrity Verification Vulnerability in Firmware Update Process of Linksys E5600


## Affected Product
Linksys E5600 (firmware version: V1.1.0.26)

## Overview

CRC integrity verification is used in verify_gemtek_header() of file checkFw.sh which verifies the new firmware in the firmware update process. CRC is improper integrity verification algorithm which could be easily bypassed as long as the hackers craft a malicious firmware with the same CRC value as the new firmware. Since the malicious firmware could bypass the integrity verification, it could be written to the IoT device and cause arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
