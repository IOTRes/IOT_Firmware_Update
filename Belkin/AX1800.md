# Firmware Integrity Verification Vulnerability in Firmware Update Process of DLink DIR619L


## Affected Product
Belkin AX1800 WiFi 6 Router (firmware version: V1.1.00.016)

## Overview
CRC32 verification is performed to verify the integrity of the new firmware in program httpd during the firmware update process. CRC32 verification could by easily bypassed if the hackers craft a malicious firmware with the same CRC32 value as the new firmware. Then, hackers could replace the new firmware with the malicious firmware during firmware update. Since the malicious firmware could bypass the CRC32 verification, it could be written to IoT device and cause arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
