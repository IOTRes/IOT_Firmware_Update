# Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Firmware Update Process of DLink DIR-619L

## Affected Product
DLink DIR-619L (firmware version: 6.02CN02)

## Overview

During the firmware update process, there is a buffer overflow vulnerability in function form_Mydlink_sign() of program boa. The variable v4 takes network data through function websGetVar(). function action_Mydlink_Web_Server() takes v4 as the third parameter. In action_Mydlink_Web_Server(), v4 is passed to v40 which  is a 256-byte character buffer through strcpy(). However, during the data propagation, there is no constraint on v4 such as strlen. Once the hackers control the network data, they could pass data which is larger than 256 byte to v4 and cause denial of service of firmware update process.
