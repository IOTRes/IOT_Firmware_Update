# Firmware Integrity Verification Vulnerability in Firmware Update Process of Netgear R6120



## Affected Product
Netgear R6120 (firmware version: V1.0.0.84)

## Overview

During firmware update process, additive checksum is applied in function check_checksum() which is invoked in program httpd_mini to perform integrity verification on new firmware for update. Since the hackers could craft a malicious firmware with the same additive checksum as the new firmware, the integrity verification could be easily bypassed. Therefore, the malicious firmware could be written to IoT device through firmware update and cause arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
